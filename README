Software package dependencies (assuming a blank Ubuntu install):
  gdata (http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list)
  python-magic (apt-get install python-magic)
  webob (easy_install webob==dev)
  gogreen (https://github.com/slideinc/gogreen)
   '-greenlet (easy_install greenlet)
     '-python-dev (apt-get install python-dev)
  python-memcache (apt-get install python-memcache)
  Cheetah templating engine (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Cheetah/2.4.4#downloads)
  python-MySQLdb (apt-get install python-MySQLdb)
    '-mysql-server (apt-get install mysql-server)


DB setup:
  mysql> CREATE DATABASE youvj;
  mysql> CREATE USER 'youvj'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'youvj';
  mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON youvj.* TO 'youvj'@'localhost';

  After the database is created, apply the schemas.
  For each file in schemas, do this:
    $ mysql -u youvj -p youvj < schemas/01-log.sql

Hostname setup:
  If you have a domain name for your system, skip this step. If
  not, we will have to fake it in order for cookies to work. Open
  /etc/hosts and add a line like:
  127.0.0.1	ppp.com

Config setup:
  The deploy script copies the config file that ends in your hostname
  over to config.py. Create a config file for your hostname by doing
  the following:

  $ cp config.py-example config.py-$HOSTNAME

  Edit this file to add your API keys, hostname and path to the source.

Server setup:
  You probably don't want to run this as root. I run on port 8080 and forward traffic
  from port 80.
  sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
